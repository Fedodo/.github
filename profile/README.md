## About The Project 🗺️

Fedodo is a decentralized Social-Media-Platform like Mastodon or Pixelfed. It also implements the **Activity Pub** protocol.
The main difference to those other platforms is that Fedodo doesn't have just the on user interface. Fedodo is designed to 
implement many different UIs. This gives the opportunity to host your own variety of Social-Media-Platforms with just one
server. In addition to this Fedodo runs easily in your Kubernetes Cluster and can be installed with one command via Helm.
